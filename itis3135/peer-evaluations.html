        <ul>
            <li>Files and folders don't have upper-cases within them. Also no spaces within file/folder names.</li>
            <li>No unnecessary underlines on words.</li>
            <li>All files for project are located within its own folder and has files for their styles, images, and scripts.</li>
            <li>No validation buttons but considering that its a website for a client I think its up to them whether it should exist or not</li>
            <li>Green banner at the top is missing a bit a green to the left. In the about page there is an indent in the paragraph but seems odd.</li>
            <li><strong>Constrast: </strong>Contrast is fine on the website. Headers are readablea against the background, banner and background contrast well. However, the regular text is a bit dark and is hard to read against the background</li>
			<li><strong>Repetition: </strong>Repetition isn't super obvious on certain pages but on Gallery we can see consistent placement/pattern of the images and caption. Also on the FAQ page it has consistent design of the headers and content below it.</li>
			<li><strong>Alignment: </strong>The alignment is consistent on their individual pages but on the gallery page it implements an alternating image pattern. FAQ center aligns everything and has consistent alignment.</li>
			<li><strong>Proximity: </strong></li>
