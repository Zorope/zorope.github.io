        <ul>
            <li>Files and folders don't have upper-cases within them. Also no spaces within file/folder names.</li>
            <li>No unnecessary underlines on words.</li>
            <li>All files for project are located within its own folder and has files for their styles, images, and scripts.</li>
            <li>No validation buttons but considering that its a website for a client I think its up to them whether it should exist or not</li>
            <li>Green banner at the top is missing a bit a green to the left. In the about page there is an indent in the paragraph but seems odd.</li>
