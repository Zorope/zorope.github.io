        <ul>
            <li>Files and folders don't have upper-cases within them. Also no spaces within file/folder names.</li>
            <li>No unnecessary underlines on words.</li>
            <li>All files for project are located within its own folder and has files for their styles, images, and scripts.</li>
            <li>No validation buttons but considering that its a website for a client I think its up to them whether it should exist or not</li>
            <li>There is an h1 tag being used as the main header in the pages.</li>
            <li><strong>Constrast: </strong>Contrast is fine on the website. Headers are readablea against the background, banner and background contrast well. However, the regular text is a bit dark and is hard to read against the background</li>
			<li><strong>Repetition: </strong>Repetition isn't super obvious on certain pages but on Gallery we can see consistent placement/pattern of the images and caption. Also on the FAQ page it has consistent design of the headers and content below it.</li>
			<li><strong>Alignment: </strong>The alignment is consistent on their individual pages but on the gallery page it implements an alternating image pattern. FAQ center aligns everything and has consistent alignment.</li>
			<li><strong>Proximity: </strong>The webpage has good proximity since it has individual pages for those items. On those page everything is placed close to each other and makes sense as to why they are close together.</li>
			<li>Every page has their header, main, and footer. There is also a navigation bar that repeats in each page.</li>
			<li>Since this is a webpage made for a client there isn't a needed brand header or tagline.</li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
            <li>Files and folders don't have upper-cases within them. Also no spaces within file/folder names.</li>
            <li>No unnecessary underlines on words.</li>
            <li>All files for project are located within its own folder and has files for their styles, images, and scripts.</li>
            <li>There are validation buttons for the webpage at the bottom of the pages</li>
            <li>There isn't an h1 tag for the header but rather an h2 is used instead.</li>
            <li><strong>Constrast: </strong>Contrast is good on the website. Headers are readablea against the background, banner and background contrast well. However, the regular text is a bit hard to read against the yellow and made me squint to read it.</li>
			<li><strong>Repetition: </strong>Each page is repetitive with all content of the pages being in a box. All borders and text sizes are the same within the boxes. Very good repetition across the whole website.</li>
			<li><strong>Alignment: </strong>Content on all pages are centered in the middle but paragraphs and images are aligned left as well. Overall everything is aligned well and makes sense.</li>
			<li><strong>Proximity: </strong>All pages have its related content put close together so the proximity is well defined.</li>
			<li>Every page has their header, main, and footer. There is also a navigation bar that repeats in each page on the left side. The footer also has links leading to external sites.</li>
			<li>The page is properly branded and has the creators design firm.</li>
