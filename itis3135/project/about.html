            <div>
                <p>
                    The club as of right now does not have a voting system for a new club leader. This club is made purely for fun and the joy of hiking.
                    We try our best to support the community and include everyone so the leader role of mainly to give a sense of leadership. However, we
                    are all working towards a common goal of creating a great community. We do have other roles to maintain order and records of club 
                    expenses and activities. Feel free to contact our club leader to ask about other club roles if you are interested.
