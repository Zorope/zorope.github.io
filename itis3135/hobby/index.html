                    <li>
                        Esports refers to the competeitive scene in gaming. 
                        Its similar to the NFL or NBA with leagues of all types of games and in many different countries. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Many modern games today easily create competitive scenes although they could die out fast. 
                        Unlinke the NFL or NBA many competitive scenes aren't 
                        sponsored by big companies but rather are supported by their communities.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        This makes esports heavily community based and not main stream. However, many esports have started to break that
                        mold and has been gathering a lot of viewership and sponsors from outside companies.
                    </li>

                <h4>Why esports is amazing!</h4>
                <p>
                    Esports are heavily community based and once you join a scene you will find hundreds of people talking about the games
                    whether it be an online forum, community group, or social media. Like soccor or baseball there are hundreds of teams around
                    the world that you can root for. Watching players play a game you love at the highest level is bound to make anyone happy.
                    With players having their platform mainly be a computer it allows for teams to connect more with their fans by streaming live on platforms
                    like twitch.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Esports allows you to easily connect with the players and organizations that run the tournaments. Givng a great
                    way to connect with the game you love more and also allows you to grow with the community while directly choosing
                    what happens. Theres nothing better than seeing a scene you are apart of grow into the mainstream.

                <h4>Background:</h4>
                <p>
                    I started following esports when I was 13 years old. My first esports scene was Counter-Strike: Global Offensive and I stayed
                    in that scene for around 3 years following my favorite team Cloud 9. Seeing them come close to winning many majors. After
                    watching this scene for a few years it got me hooked on esports and made me understand peoples love for events like the
                    Super Bowl. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Today I mainly follow 2 esport scenes being League of Legends and Apex Legends. Throughout the years I find it amazing how no matter
                    the genere the game is there is a sense of unity in all communities. Every competitive scene in esports know of each other and understand
                    most rules or mechanics within a game even if they haven't played it much.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I made this website to apperciate scenes that I had been apart of and scenes I am apart of. I have many friends that also
                    enjoy these tournaments and often its hard to follow which tournaments are big for other games. Often esports have many 
                    small tournaments and then a major one at the end of the season like most sports. However, often these end of season tournaments
                    involve the best teams from every region around the world. Making esports even more exiciting to root for your region and see
                    how amazing other regions are at the game as well. This is why I love esports and it community.

                <h4>Esports Cultural Importance:</h4>
                <p>
                    Esports in my opinion has become one of the biggest sports to incorporate the public.
                    Becoming a pro in esports doesn't require years upon years of training to gather the knowledge
                    and skills to match those that are already in the pro scene. Anyone can essentially become a pro
                    if they grab onto opportunities. However, that also means that pros are easily replaced but if you stay in a
                    scene long enough you will forever be remembered and engraved into the games you play. Many players 
                    cemented themselves in the game so much that the developers themselves put monuments in the game for the players.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Its beautiful how intergrated the community is with the game and organizations of the pro scene. It is continuing
                    to pave a path to create more intimate relationships between the sport and its people. Esports a great scene that
                    continues to grow while still thinking of its audience.
